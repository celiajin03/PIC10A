# PIC 10A Programming Projects
This repository contains my programming projects for an introductory C++ course, covering basic principles of programming, procedural problem solving, program design and development, and more.


Each folder corresponds to a specific programming project. The opening of each main file within a folder provides a description of the corresponding project.
